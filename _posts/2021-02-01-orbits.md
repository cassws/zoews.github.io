### Clark Park satellite

Last Sunday, I was lying out on the floor next to my cat Jane holding an e-ink page of *Parable of the Talents* in front of my face. The novel's protagonist, Lauren/Olamina works so, so hard to take care of the ember of community. 

Making my way through those pages (I'm a slow reader) made me notice my loneliness in that moment -- I decided want to keep doing what I'm doing, but closer-ish (COVID-permitting) to other humans. 

Anyways, frigid day!, but I put on my mask and convertible mitten-gloves and found a bench in the park and hunkered down. As I did, I noticed a woman walking by - she had on a fluffy bright coat, and she was holding a smartphone flat so that the speaker was closest to her ear. She took each step with a kind of bouncy power-walk stride, and sang along beautifully to a pop song playing on the phone (maybe she was streaming a radio station?)

I settled back into Olamina's story. Earthseed, marketplaces, fucking fascist presidential candidates... and after a few minutes, I hear the familiar muffled-speaker, happy swishy jacket, going-for-it-woman. I look up and try to do that smile-with-my-eyes thing, but the woman doesn't notice me -- she's *in it*. 

I'm sitting on a bench near the edge of this section of the park - maybe an 8 o'clock on a park face. I think that she must be walking in a big circuit across the park. Walk, swish, sing, new track. The third time, it's definitely a cycle. The fourth, she's listening to something off *Purple Rain*. 

I go back into my book. It's rough stuff in this passage. It's rough stuff right now in general, in every direction. But the fifth time the woman walks past, I feel this kind of ambient gentleness sink into me a little bit -- this orbit of gentle belonging.

### Orbits I've known and loved lately

* Coffee wintry walks
* Video game crit podcasts loading into my Podcasts
* The part of the afternoon where my window lets in direct light, and I put Spidey Boi on the swivel chair to soak it up
* My weekly therapy session
* The video game group at Recurse! Those excited video game design conversations!
* Stew Night
* The 34 trolley honking down the street (from a meme: "IT WANTS TO SING")
* Jane hopping onto her blanket when it's time for bed


### Celestial mechanics

I'm aware of the winter this year in a way I've never been before. The feeling of a frosting-over, of low energy, of rarified light. We are tired. I am tired. 

I like to think in seasons. Seasons let us speak about something awful in clear terms - this is a season of exhaustion and pain for so many, and so many so much more strongly than mine - and without having to brighter-side anything, we can also connect with a planetary understanding of how seasons change, eventually, theoretically.

That super-clear deep winter sky is such a wonderful counter-weight to everything else. I went out to the park a few weeks back and looked up and watched the moon rise for a while. In that moment, I realized, hmm, I had never really thought about the brightening of the moon relative to the position of the sun and earth. I had never puzzled over the dynamics of these celestial bodies - as in, I saw the moon as alone possessing phases and brightness and positions, but not as expressing interaction that was open to me directly. 

Why? I just hadn't - no big reason! I had recently started playing Outer Wilds lately - an *incredible* game - and the tricky dynamics of landing on a planet (let alone a planet with a black hole at its center..!) must have primed me to think about celestial mechanics. 

But that fact thrilled me! There was this entire rhythm that had been going on my entire life, shaping the phases of moons, and the tides, and the eclipses, and it had never crossed my horizon of awareness long enough to puzzle over.

### Orbits are kind

We are all nestled into pockets between orbits - little gravitational puzzles that hold us. Sometimes we don't notice the orbits around us, or the orbits we make for others, but they go on anyway. Swish, sing, swish.

I sincerely set out to write something about data analysis and investigating data - I'm sure I will again sometime - but for now I think noticing orbits is enough, and noticing their kindness.
