    <h3>My goal is to help learners, researchers, and communities engage meaningfully (and critically) with data.</h3>
    <p>
    In 2011, I served in AmeriCorps at the lovely & bustling Rondo Community Outreach Library in Saint Paul, Minnesota. I spent my time at the Rondo teaching adult learners from diverse backrounds how to use computers from the ground-up: double-clicking, browsing Wikipedia, and (eventually!) entering functions into Excel. 
    </p><p>
    Over the last eight years, I have grown my fondness for digital instruction into a deep engagement with data science. My fous today is to craft insight from messy, heterogenous data, while always putting everyday folks and their needs at the center of my work.
</p>
<p>
    As the <b>Data Instructional Specialist II at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia</b>, I specialize in teaching methods of finding & interpreting data. My techniques of choice include exploring semi-structured and unstructured data, introducing learners to the Python and R data science ecosystems, writing data narratives using visualization packages and Jupyter Notebook, and helping researchers understand machine learning algorithms better. I also work collaboratively to plan workshops, build digital resource portals, and host community events.
</p>
<p>
    And as a <b>data scientist and technical writer</b>, I investigate messy, heterogenous data directly using machine learning techniques. As I experiment and grow technically, I help others do the same by writing essays and tutorials.

<h3> I'm into other stuff too!</h3>
<p>
    Outside of work I love writing, pinball, zines, hikes, cats, speculative fiction, making games, playing pick-up basketbll, and riding trains. I lived in Tokyo for half a year. I would love to moonlight as a pinball mechanic someday.</p>
