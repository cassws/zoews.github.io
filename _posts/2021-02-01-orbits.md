### Radio satellite

Last weekend, I was lying out on the floor next to my cat Jane holding an e-ink page of *Parable of the Talents* in front of my face. The novel's protagonist, Lauren/Olamina works so, so hard to take care of the ember of community. 

Making my way through those pages (I'm a slow reader) made me notice my loneliness in that moment -- I decided want to keep doing what I'm doing, but closer-ish to other humans. 

Anyways, frigid day!, but I put on my mask and convertible mitten-gloves and found a bench in the park and hunkered down. As I did, I noticed a woman walking by - she had on a fluffy bright coat, and she was holding a smartphone flat so that the speaker was closest to her ear. She took each step with a kind of bouncy power-walk stride, and sang along to a pop song I didn't recognize.

I settled back into Lauren's story. Earthseed, marketplaces, fucking fascist presidents... and after a few minutes, I heard the familiar muffled-speaker, happy swishy jacket, going-for-it-woman. I looked up and tried to do that smile-with-my-eyes thing, but the woman doesn't notice me -- she's *in it*. 

I sat on a bench near the edge of this section of the park. I thought that she must be walking in a big circuit across the park. Walk, swish, sing, new track. The third time, it's definitely a cycle. The fourth, she's listening to something off *Purple Rain*. 

I went back into my book. It was rough stuff in this passage. It's rough stuff right now in general, in every direction. But the fifth time the woman walked past, I felt this kind of ambient gentleness sink into me a little bit -- this orbit of gentle belonging.

### Orbits I've known and loved lately

* Coffee walks in the neighborhood
* Video game crit podcasts loading into my Podcasts
* The part of the afternoon where my window lets in direct light, and I put Spidey Boi on the swivel chair to soak it up
* My weekly e-therapy session
* The video game group at Recurse! Those excited video game design conversations!
* Stew Night
* The 34 trolley honking down the street (from a meme: "IT WANTS TO SING")
* Jane hopping onto her blanket when it's time for bed

### Celestial mechanics

I feel the winter this year in a way I've never been before. The feeling of frosted over, no energy, rarified light. We are tired. I am tired. 

I like to think in seasons. Seasons let us speak about something awful in clear terms - this is a season of exhaustion, and so many are suffering acutely and horrifically. The fact of a season is that low-point of warmth and light, and also the awareness, however faintly, that seasons change. (I'm still in Octavia Butler's world as I write this.)

I love the sky in winter, especially at its coldest and clearest. I went out to the park a few weeks back and looked up and watched the moon rise for a while. In that moment, I realized, hmm, I had never really thought about the brightening of the moon relative to the position of the sun and earth. I had never puzzled over the dynamics of these celestial bodies - as in, I saw the moon as alone possessing phases and brightness and positions, but not as expressing an interaction that was open to me directly. 

I'm not sure why I hadn't thought about it that way before. I had recently started playing Outer Wilds lately - an *incredible* game - and the tricky dynamics of landing on a planet (let alone a planet with a black hole at its center..!) had definitely primed me to think about the position of planets and moons in a new way.

That fact thrilled me! There was this entire rhythm that had been going on my entire life, shaping the phases of moons, and the tides, and the eclipses, and it had NEVER crossed my horizon of awareness long enough to puzzle over. 

The moon looked so pretty up there.

### Orbits are kind

I like remembering to notice the orbits. I haven't always used this language, but I've spent a lot of my life going to cafes and parks and gorge paths as a way to understand my belonging in something bigger.

We are all nestled into pockets between orbits - gravitational puzzles that hold us in deep interlocked patterns. We hold others the same way, too. Even in this goddamn winter.

Maybe that's useful for you, too :)
